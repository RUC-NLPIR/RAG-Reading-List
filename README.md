# RAG-Reading-List

This repository is used to collect recent studies on RAG methods, benchmarks, and toolkits. Welcome any updates through pull requests.

### Method

1. **In-Context Retrieval-Augmented Language Models**
   - arXiv, https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00083
   - Ori Ram, Yoav Levine, Itay Dalmedigos, Dor Muhlgay, Amnon Shashua, Kevin Leyton-Brown, Yoav Shoham
   - Using retrieved results can effectively imrpove LLMs' performance. Retrieve after every $k$ tokens, and the performance can be improved when $k$ is small (more frequent retrieval). Reranking is also helpful.
